# Mephisto!
Mephisto is the meaningful crowdworking cloud platform to perform Human Intelligence Tasks within Powertrain.
Mantra: Humans do distinct tasks that computers currently can't for a higher purpose. 

## Why?
Don't generate pointless CAPTCHAS that do not contribute to Business Value.
Rather, provide a platform (and API for third-party applications) to integrate humans extensively in nowadays digital transformation and facilitate human contribution to foster continous improvement.
Specifically, Statistical Learning algorithms (Supervised Machine or Deep Learning) require large amounts of human-annotated data to be trained successfully.
Powertrain data needs to be carefully selected, dry-nursed, enriched and mindfully preserved.

## What's Mephisto's purpose?
Mephisto bundles these aspects uniquely and includes:
- process multivariate time series data of processes that inherit physical phenomena that are not intuitive and need (extensive) domain knowledge
- annotate phenomena to data and track (rare) anomalies
- data cleaning by removing data streams not necessary for upstream algorithms
- verify data plausibility by intrinsic and extrinsic (meta GraphDB data) information
- encourage data-driven crowdworking and objective validation
- combine different data ressources to gain discrete data-driven insights

## Is this evil?
Mehpisto is no devil.
The idea behind this project is to suplement Machine Intelligence with Human Knowledge.
Mephisto is a type of Human Machine Collaboration where computers (or algorithm requirements) pose questions to humans who solve them diligently.
By solving this "Human Intelligence Tasks", complex knowledge can be stored well-organized and provides the basis to train artificial intelligence (AI) and reach higher levels to ask new more sophisticated questions.

## If this helps everyone to master digital transformation - why is it called Mephisto?
Name sponsor is the [Mephisto Automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mephisto_(automaton)) - a chess robot in the 19th century.
It won several chess matches against the best human players and seemingly dominated humans.
In reality, this automaton was human guided in a somewhat sophisticated way and fabricated machine intelligence superiority.
This is also the case for nowadays overrated AI which is till now far away from true (human) intelligence (see status to artificial general intelligence, causal inference etc.).
This holds true especially in the current Powertrain setting.
As such, Mephisto is a tool to help mock human intelligence and partly integrate human knowledge into our algorithms to assist human tasks in our digital and fast world.
